""" 
    To be a dictionary key nodes have to be of a hashable type
    Hash-ability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member,
    because these data structures use the hash value internally.
    All of Pythonâ€™s immutable built-in objects are hashable,
    while no mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are.
    Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default;
    they all compare unequal, and their hash value is their id().
    
    in practice this might be a pretty severe limitation but our purposes
    is learn some graph theory we are going to use integers and strings
    we won`t run into any problems
