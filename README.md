# Data structures & Memory With C

I decided to learn some basic programming concepts in C because it is the foundation of many other programming languages, and learning it can help you understand how computers work at a fundamental level, which can be useful for anyone interested in computer science. Additionally, learning C programming can provide you with a solid foundation in programming concepts and principles that can be applied to other languages.

Data structures are an important part of computer science. They provide a means of effectively organizing and storing large amounts of data in a way that allows for efficient access and modification. C is a popular choice for learning data structures because it is a low-level language that gives the programmer a lot of control over how the program interacts with the computer's memory. Using C can give you the advantage of understanding data structures from a low-level perspective. One of the key benefits of C is that it doesn`t have any built-in functions or abstracted data types. This means you will need to create them yourself, which can provide a deeper understanding of these topics.

Some topics that I focused on :

 - Data Structures
   - Array
   - Linked list
   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Tree
   - Hashing
   - Graph
 - Pointers
 - Memory allocation
 - Garbage values

## Additional Lessons Learned

I learned to use git version control and git bash while creating this repository. 

I wanted to use Valgrind to detect memory leaks in C. Valgrind is a linux program so I installed WLS to use it. And now I can use Linux applications, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows. Which is extremely useful  ðŸ˜Ž

## Graph Theory and Programming Languages

I recently completed my work on data structures topics, with the exception of one topic - graph theory. When it came time to delve into this subject, I found myself with numerous videos and papers open in my browser, and it took me an entire day to emerge from this "rabbit hole" of information. I had initially intended for this repository to contain only C code, but ultimately decided to use Python to address the topic of graphs instead. As a result, the repository will include both C and Python code, even though the title may still reference "C."

Additionally, I have a strong desire to understand programming languages in general and have been searching about various languages in my spare time. For example, while I have no practical need to learn JavaScript, I am really interested in how it works. Further, I encountered Java frequently in my studies and gave considerable thought to learning object-oriented programming using Java, but ultimately decided to Python once again. Finally, I had intended to learn a functional programming language specifically designed for that paradigm, but I ultimately decided that it would be more beneficial for me to focus on Python's functional programming capabilities in greater depth.

Once I have completed the topics I have selected for this repository, I plan to create another repository containing Python code related to programming paradigms and algorithms. It is possible that I may also incorporate the Scala in this future repository. Who knowsÂ¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
