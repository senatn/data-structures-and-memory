# Data structures & Memory With C

I decided to learn some basic programming concepts in C because it is the foundation of many other programming languages, and learning it can help you understand how computers work at a fundamental level, which can be useful for anyone interested in computer science. Additionally, learning C programming can provide you with a solid foundation in programming concepts and principles that can be applied to other languages.

Data structures are an important part of computer science. They provide a means of effectively organizing and storing large amounts of data in a way that allows for efficient access and modification. C is a popular choice for learning data structures because it is a low-level language that gives the programmer a lot of control over how the program interacts with the computer's memory. Using C can give you the advantage of understanding data structures from a low-level perspective. One of the key benefits of C is that it doesn`t have any built-in functions or abstracted data types. This means you will need to create them yourself, which can provide a deeper understanding of these topics.

Some topics that I focused on :

 - Data Structures 
   - Array
   - Linked lists
   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Tree
   - Hashing
   - Graph
 - Pointers / Pointer arithmetic
 - Memory allocation / Garbage values

## Additional Lessons Learned

I learned to use git version control and git bash while creating this repository. 

I wanted to use Valgrind to detect memory leaks in C. Valgrind is a linux program so I installed WLS to use it. And now I can use Linux applications, and Bash command-line tools directly on Windows. Which is extremely useful  ðŸ˜Ž
